Some research groups have their own internal workshops or seminars - please update the sections with links to slides or contacts \(or any other useful information\), so that students from other groups can get in touch and attend the seminar.  


On Nov 26 2014, Li-Yi Wei gave a talk “How to make a top research paper while having all the fun”. Some of the advices are on his blog: [http://blog.liyiwei.org/?tag=advice](http://blog.liyiwei.org/?tag=advice), and the slides are \(temporarily\) under [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ontqjhb62qe65x7/siga14.pptx?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ontqjhb62qe65x7/siga14.pptx?dl=0)

The approach in his talk is in essence: start writing a paper from Day 0 \(even if you have just a vague idea\), log everything there \(including comments -- he uses it instead of email/IM or face-to-face meetings with his students\) + use LaTeX \(you can easily script/automate things + works better with VCS\) + use VCS \(Git, SVN, …\) for everything.
