# Writing Skills

Graduate School, from time to time, organizes 3-hour writing workshop -- compared with their compulsory semester-long Thesis Writing course, I found the workshop a bit more practical \(but don’t expect too much -- also, some writing requirements, such as article structuring, are different in CS and this workshop taught general scientific writing\). --ttauber
