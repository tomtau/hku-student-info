# Conference Travelling Tips

One possible way to reduce costs associated with overseas conferences is to apply to be a student volunteer \(if the conference offers this option\) -- you will be expected to help with running the conference \(e.g. being a receptionist for several hours\) in exchange for discounts for the conference registration fees, free accommodation etc. that can lower associated travel expenses.

The University provides conference grants to all research postgraduates. You have to apply it through HKUPortal at least 14 days before the conference. And the maximum grant is 13,500 HKD. Link: [http://www.rss.hku.hk/fund/conference-students](http://www.rss.hku.hk/fund/conference-students) . And the Department of CS provides conference support for 3,000 HKD for conferences held in Asia and 6,000 HKD for conferences held otherwise.

As a side note, to those students that struggled hard for their paper through, especially MPhil, you might hesitate whether you can get grants from the University/Department. The University/Department allows you to apply for the grant for a trip that is before you receive the Graduation Letter from Graduate School. In other words, if you have a paper accepted for a conference, and the conference is held after thesis submission and the leap of candidature, but before receiving of Graduation Letter, you are still eligible to apply for the grants. But for University-level grant, you will not be able to apply through HKU Portal. Send Research Services an email and they will give you a hard copy form.
